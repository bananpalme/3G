# this Repo is a modified version of sveltejs template to be used in programming class. Yipee!



## svelte app

- a svelte app consists of a main.js file - this is where the show begins 
- It imports App.svelte which is our starting point
- From there we can create our own sub-components, usually in the folder 'components'
